# Dotfiles

A minimal repository dedicated to hosting my Guix System and Guix Home configs and dotfiles.

Utilizing [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) in order to synchronize system configs.

## How it works

This repository hosts valuable Guix configuration files that ensure my machines are consistent. Dotfiles are managed by Guix, ensuring a consistent state.
